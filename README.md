# MollsTravelPage

##About
A good friend of mine recently went on a trip to Europe (her first!) and, as a favor, asked me to create a website she could share with friends and family. I decided on a simply AngularJS framework to practice that bit more. I also used Google's Materiall Design Bootstrap for the layout and some of the styling, namely the carousels. Additionally, the ngParallax for AngularJS was key to the design of the landing page. I didn't draw on a database for this one, so there wasn't much need for controllers, although Angular requires that you have them. You'll notice most of those are blank.

###Required packages to install:
1. mdbootstrap (Material Design Bootstrap)
2. angular (AngularJS)
3. angular-route(ngRoute)

####General Observations
This came together much easier for me than the previous projects I've done with Angular. I owe a bit of that to the general flatness of the overall look of the site as well as greater familiarity with Angular. Not having to rely on external data in the form of a JSON file or an API also made it a much easier task.
